# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The event extraction system is currently experiencing conversion issues where events are successfully found during the scraping phase but fail to be converted into the final data format. This results in "No events found in extracted data" errors despite the scraper finding events (e.g., 22 events from parentmap.com, 38 from remlingerfarms.com). This critical bug prevents the platform from displaying any events to users, making the core functionality non-operational.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the event extraction pipeline to successfully convert scraped events into the proper data format, so that events appear on the frontend for families to discover.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN events are found during the scraping phase THEN the system SHALL successfully convert them to the expected data structure
2. WHEN the conversion process encounters malformed data THEN the system SHALL log specific error details and continue processing other events
3. WHEN events are successfully converted THEN they SHALL appear in the pending events review interface
4. WHEN the conversion process completes THEN the system SHALL report the actual number of events converted, not just found

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed error logging and diagnostics for the conversion process, so that I can quickly identify and fix data transformation issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conversion error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the specific field or data structure causing the failure
2. WHEN processing multiple events THEN the system SHALL continue processing remaining events even if some fail conversion
3. WHEN conversion issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide sample data showing the expected vs actual format
4. WHEN debugging conversion issues THEN the system SHALL log both the raw scraped data and the attempted conversion result

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the event extraction system to handle different website data formats gracefully, so that events from various sources can be successfully processed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing events from different websites THEN the system SHALL adapt to varying date formats, event structures, and field names
2. WHEN encountering missing required fields THEN the system SHALL either provide sensible defaults or skip the event with appropriate logging
3. WHEN processing events with inconsistent data quality THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize the data before conversion
4. WHEN new website formats are encountered THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully and provide actionable error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a family user, I want to see events from parentmap.com and remlingerfarms.com on the platform, so that I can discover local family activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN visiting the main application THEN I SHALL see events successfully extracted from parentmap.com
2. WHEN visiting the main application THEN I SHALL see events successfully extracted from remlingerfarms.com  
3. WHEN events are displayed THEN they SHALL include all essential information (title, date, location, description)
4. WHEN events have conversion issues THEN the system SHALL still display successfully converted events from the same source
