# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature modernizes the Seattle Family Activities Platform frontend interface by replacing the current custom CSS design system with Tailwind CSS. The goal is to create a consistent, modern, and maintainable styling approach while keeping the library lightweight and following Tailwind CSS best practices.

## Glossary

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces
- **Frontend Interface**: The client-side web application consisting of index.html and admin.html pages
- **Design System**: The collection of reusable components, patterns, and styles used throughout the application
- **Utility Classes**: Small, single-purpose CSS classes that can be combined to build complex designs
- **CDN Integration**: Loading Tailwind CSS via Content Delivery Network for lightweight implementation without build tools
- **Build System**: A compilation process that transforms source code into production-ready assets (NOT required for this implementation)
- **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive design approach that starts with mobile layouts and scales up
