# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for modernizing the Seattle Family Activities Platform with a unified, state-of-the-art UX design system that combines Glassmorphism and Neumorphism principles. The goal is to create a cohesive, beautiful, and highly usable interface that appeals to families while maintaining excellent accessibility and mobile-first responsiveness.

## Glossary

- **Design_System**: A comprehensive set of design standards, components, and guidelines that ensure consistency across the platform
- **Glassmorphism**: A design trend featuring frosted glass effects, transparency, and subtle backgrounds
- **Neumorphism**: A design approach using soft shadows and highlights to create tactile, button-like interface elements
- **Component_Library**: Reusable UI components with consistent styling and behavior
- **Accessibility_Standards**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance requirements for inclusive design
- **Mobile_First_Design**: Design approach prioritizing mobile experience before desktop
- **Animation_System**: Coordinated micro-interactions and transitions throughout the interface

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a family looking for activities, I want a visually appealing and modern interface, so that I feel confident using the platform and can easily find relevant information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Design_System SHALL implement glassmorphism effects with 10-20% background transparency and subtle blur effects
2. THE Design_System SHALL use neumorphic elements for interactive components with soft inset/outset shadows
3. THE Design_System SHALL maintain consistent visual hierarchy with modern typography scaling from 12px to 48px
4. THE Design_System SHALL provide smooth micro-animations with 200-300ms duration for all interactive elements
5. THE Design_System SHALL ensure all design elements meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user browsing activities on-the-go, I want the interface to be touch-friendly and responsive, so that I can easily interact with all features on my phone.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices, THE Design_System SHALL provide touch targets of minimum 44px x 44px
2. THE Design_System SHALL implement responsive breakpoints at 480px, 768px, 1024px, and 1400px
3. THE Design_System SHALL use flexible grid systems that adapt content layout across all screen sizes
4. THE Design_System SHALL ensure neumorphic buttons provide clear pressed/active states for touch feedback
5. THE Design_System SHALL maintain readable text sizes with minimum 16px base font size on mobile

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the modern design to remain fully accessible, so that I can use all platform features regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Design_System SHALL provide high contrast mode alternatives for all glassmorphic elements
2. THE Design_System SHALL ensure all interactive elements are keyboard navigable with visible focus indicators
3. THE Design_System SHALL implement proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure
4. THE Design_System SHALL support screen readers with descriptive text for all visual elements
5. THE Design_System SHALL provide reduced motion alternatives for users with vestibular disorders

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the platform, I want a consistent component library, so that I can efficiently implement new features while maintaining design consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Component_Library SHALL provide reusable card components with both glassmorphic and neumorphic variants
2. THE Component_Library SHALL include button components with consistent hover, active, and disabled states
3. THE Component_Library SHALL implement form components with unified styling and validation states
4. THE Component_Library SHALL provide navigation components with smooth transitions and active states
5. THE Component_Library SHALL include modal and overlay components with proper backdrop blur effects

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user browsing activities, I want smooth and delightful interactions, so that the platform feels modern and engaging to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Animation_System SHALL implement staggered loading animations for activity cards
2. THE Animation_System SHALL provide smooth page transitions with 300ms duration
3. THE Animation_System SHALL include hover effects that enhance neumorphic depth perception
4. THE Animation_System SHALL implement scroll-triggered animations with intersection observer
5. THE Animation_System SHALL ensure all animations respect user's reduced motion preferences

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want the admin interface to follow the same modern design principles, so that there's consistency between public and admin areas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Design_System SHALL apply consistent styling to admin dashboard components
2. THE Design_System SHALL implement glassmorphic overlays for admin modals and confirmations
3. THE Design_System SHALL use neumorphic styling for admin form controls and buttons
4. THE Design_System SHALL maintain the same color palette and typography across admin and public interfaces
5. THE Design_System SHALL ensure admin-specific components (tables, charts) integrate seamlessly with the design system
