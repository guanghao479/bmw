## Introduction

This feature redesigns the Seattle Family Activities Platform header and filter system to follow Airbnb's experience page design patterns. The focus is on creating a consistent header experience across both index and detail pages, with improved filter navigation that matches Airbnb's design approach.

## Glossary

- **Frontend_Interface**: The client-side web application including index.html and detail pages
- **Header_Component**: The top navigation section with logo, filters, and action buttons
- **Filter_Navigation**: The horizontal filter system for activity categories
- **Logo_Section**: The branding area positioned on the top left of the header
- **Action_Buttons**: User interface elements positioned on the top right of the header
- **Tailwind_CSS**: The utility-first CSS framework used for styling
- **Active_Filter_State**: The visual indication showing which filter category is currently selected
- **Responsive_Breakpoint**: Screen width thresholds where layout adapts (320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px)
