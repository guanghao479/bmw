This feature redesigns the Seattle Family Activities Platform header and filter system to follow Airbnb's experience page design patterns. The focus is on creating a consistent header experience across both index and detail pages, with improved filter navigation that matches Airbnb's design approach.

- **Tailwind_CSS**: The utility-first CSS framework used for styling
- **Active_Filter_State**: The visual indication that displays which filter option is currently selected by the user
- **Responsive_Breakpoint**: Screen width thresholds where layout adapts (320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px)
- **Date_Filter**: Interactive date selection component integrated within the Filter_Navigation
- **Search_Filter**: Expandable search input component integrated within the Filter_Navigation
- **Filter_Expansion**: The behavior where search and date filters expand when activated by user interaction
- **Category_Filter**: Filter buttons on the top row that allow users to select content type (All, Events, Activities, Venues)
- **Category_Specific_Filters**: Filter buttons on the bottom row that change based on selected category (search, date, price, etc.)
