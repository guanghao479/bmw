# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds comprehensive delete source functionality to the Seattle Family Activities admin source management system. The feature enables administrators to permanently remove sources from the system, including all associated data (submissions, analysis, configurations, and scraped activities), with proper safeguards and confirmation workflows.

## Glossary

- **Admin_Interface**: The web-based administrative interface for managing sources
- **Source_Management_System**: The backend system that handles source lifecycle operations
- **DynamoDB_Service**: The data persistence layer that stores source and activity data
- **Source_Record**: A complete source entry including submission, analysis, and configuration data
- **Associated_Activities**: Events and activities that were scraped from a specific source
- **Confirmation_Dialog**: A UI component that requires explicit user confirmation before destructive actions

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to delete sources that are no longer relevant or functional, so that I can maintain a clean and accurate source database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the administrator clicks a delete button for a source, THE Admin_Interface SHALL display a confirmation dialog with source details
2. WHEN the administrator confirms deletion in the confirmation dialog, THE Source_Management_System SHALL permanently remove the source record and all associated data
3. WHEN the deletion is successful, THE Admin_Interface SHALL display a success message and refresh the source list
4. WHEN the deletion fails, THE Admin_Interface SHALL display an error message with failure details
5. THE Admin_Interface SHALL provide a delete button for each source in the source management grid

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to see what data will be deleted before confirming, so that I can make informed decisions about source removal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the delete confirmation dialog appears, THE Admin_Interface SHALL display the source name, URL, and number of associated activities
2. WHEN the delete confirmation dialog appears, THE Admin_Interface SHALL show the last scrape date and total activities found
3. THE Confirmation_Dialog SHALL require explicit confirmation by typing the source name or clicking a clearly labeled delete button
4. THE Confirmation_Dialog SHALL provide a cancel option that closes the dialog without any changes
5. THE Confirmation_Dialog SHALL warn about the permanent nature of the deletion action

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the backend to safely delete all source-related data, so that no orphaned records remain in the database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a source deletion is requested, THE DynamoDB_Service SHALL delete the source submission record
2. WHEN a source deletion is requested, THE DynamoDB_Service SHALL delete the source analysis record if it exists
3. WHEN a source deletion is requested, THE DynamoDB_Service SHALL delete the source configuration record if it exists
4. WHEN a source deletion is requested, THE DynamoDB_Service SHALL delete all associated activity records from that source
5. IF any deletion operation fails, THEN THE DynamoDB_Service SHALL rollback all changes and return an error

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the delete functionality to be secure and auditable, so that accidental deletions can be tracked and prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a source is deleted, THE Source_Management_System SHALL log the deletion event with administrator identity and timestamp
2. WHEN a source deletion is attempted, THE Source_Management_System SHALL validate that the requesting user has admin privileges
3. THE Admin_Interface SHALL disable the delete button during the deletion process to prevent duplicate requests
4. THE Source_Management_System SHALL return detailed error messages for failed deletion attempts
5. WHEN a source is successfully deleted, THE Source_Management_System SHALL record the deletion in the admin events log
