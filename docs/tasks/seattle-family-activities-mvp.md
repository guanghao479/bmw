# Seattle Family Activities MVP Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement an ultra-minimal MVP for a family activities platform that scrapes Seattle-area family activity websites using Jina + OpenAI and serves data via S3 JSON files to a GitHub Pages frontend.

## Architecture Summary
- **Frontend**: GitHub Pages static site in `/app/` directory
- **Backend**: AWS Lambda (us-west-2) with Go runtime
- **Storage**: S3 bucket with public JSON files
- **Scraping**: Jina AI Reader + OpenAI GPT-4o mini
- **Scheduling**: EventBridge every 6 hours
- **No database**: Pure file-based storage
- **No admin portal**: AWS Console for manual operations
