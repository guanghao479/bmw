# Seattle Family Activities MVP Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement an ultra-minimal MVP for a family activities platform that scrapes Seattle-area family activity websites using Jina + OpenAI and serves data via S3 JSON files to a GitHub Pages frontend.

## Architecture Summary
- **Frontend**: GitHub Pages static site in `/app/` directory
- **Backend**: AWS Lambda (us-west-2) with Go runtime
- **Storage**: S3 bucket with public JSON files
- **Scraping**: Jina AI Reader + OpenAI GPT-4o mini
- **Scheduling**: EventBridge every 6 hours
- **No database**: Pure file-based storage
- **No admin portal**: AWS Console for manual operations

## Data Schema Design

- Enhanced filtering by activity type, category, age group
- Real-time data refresh with user notifications
- Graceful degradation for offline usage

## Success Metrics

**Data Quality:**
- Successfully scrape 50+ activities from 5+ Seattle sources
- 90%+ data extraction accuracy with complete fields
- Consistent categorization across all sources

**Technical Performance:**
- Sub-3 second initial load time
- 99%+ uptime with S3 reliability
- Graceful error handling for all failure scenarios

**Cost Efficiency:**
- Total monthly cost under $10
- Scalable to 10x traffic without significant cost increase

## Risk Mitigation

**Technical Risks:**
- S3 outage → Browser caching + embedded data fallback
- Lambda timeout → Batch processing with retries
- API rate limits → Exponential backoff
- JSON file growth → Monitor size, implement pagination

**Data Quality Risks:**
- Source website changes → Multiple sources for redundancy
- Extraction accuracy → Manual validation during MVP
- Duplicate content → ID-based deduplication

**Business Risks:**
- Legal compliance → Only public data, respect robots.txt
- Data freshness → 6-hour update cycle with manual triggers

## Next Steps After Plan Approval

1. Create directory structure and move files
2. Set up AWS CDK infrastructure
3. Implement Go backend with enhanced data models
4. Update frontend for S3 integration
5. Deploy and test end-to-end functionality

**Estimated Total Development Time: 12-16 hours over 1.5 days**
