# Core Extraction Functionality Unit Tests - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of task 4.3: "Write focused unit tests for core extraction functionality" from the event-extraction-fix specification.

## Test Coverage Implemented

### 1. Markdown Parsing with Real Content Samples ✅

**ParentMap Content Testing:**
- Tests extraction from realistic ParentMap calendar format
- Validates extraction of specific events: Kids Art Workshop, Family Movie Night, Story Time
- Verifies extraction of event details: dates, times, locations, age groups, pricing
- Handles structured markdown with headers, bold formatting, and event details

**Remlinger Farms Content Testing:**
- Tests extraction from realistic Remlinger Farms event format  
- Validates extraction of seasonal and year-round activities
- Verifies extraction of: Pumpkin Patch, Holiday Light Spectacular, Farm Animal Experience, Train Rides
- Handles different date formats and pricing structures

### 2. Schema Conversion with Malformed Data Scenarios ✅

**Missing Required Fields:**
- Tests conversion when title and date are missing
- Validates graceful handling with appropriate confidence scoring (30%)
- Verifies detailed error reporting and suggestions

**Invalid Data Formats:**
- Tests conversion with invalid date formats ("not-a-valid-date")
- Tests conversion with invalid time formats ("25:99 PM")
- Validates system maintains high confidence (85%) while reporting specific validation issues

**Wrong Schema Structure:**
- Tests conversion when data uses "activities" instead of "events" key
- Tests conversion when field names don't match expected schema ("name" vs "title")
- Validates system's ability to find alternative arrays and field mappings

**Partial Data Recovery:**
- Tests conversion with mixed valid/invalid events in same array
- Validates system processes valid events despite some invalid ones
- Verifies reasonable confidence scoring (70%) for partial recovery

### 3. Error Handling for Missing Events and Conversion Failures ✅

**Missing Events Scenarios:**
- Empty events array: Handled gracefully with nil activity return
- Nil raw data: Proper error reporting with descriptive messages
- Empty raw data: Appropriate error handling with suggestions

**Conversion Failure Scenarios:**
- Unsupported schema types: Clear error messages with valid options
- Graceful degradation: Progressive confidence reduction as data quality decreases
  - Missing optional fields: 70% confidence
  - Missing location: 65% confidence  
  - Only title: 45% confidence

## Key Test Features

### Comprehensive Diagnostics
- All tests include detailed conversion diagnostics
- Field mapping tracking with confidence scores
- Processing time measurement
- Issue categorization (error/warning/info)
- Detailed suggestions for data improvement

### Realistic Test Data
- Uses actual ParentMap and Remlinger Farms content structures
- Tests real-world markdown formatting challenges
- Validates extraction of complex event information

### Robust Error Handling
- Tests system resilience to various failure modes
- Validates appropriate error messages and suggestions
- Ensures system doesn't crash on malformed data
